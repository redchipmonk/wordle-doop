# wordle-doop

<h3> Project Description </h3>

Welcome to a duplication of Wordle! In this project, I intended to create a wordle to play in the terminal by using 
Java to practice my Java skills after taking CS 142 at Edmonds College. This program takes a random word from a text 
file which contains a word bank. The words are from https://7esl.com/. A challenge that I ran into was making sure
that a letter with double letters would not get highlighted twice if the word only had one of the letter. Another 
challenge was implementing the keyboard class to simulate the order of a keyboard rather than the alphabet. In the 
future, I hope to implement this program in a GUI or website, but I have not learned about GUIs yet.
